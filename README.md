# UICollectionViewLayoutDemo

This repository contains the source code for a demo project showing how to implement a custom UICollectionViewLayout using Auto Layout and supporting Dynamic Type.  The list is linear on smaller devices, but supports a grid view on iPad, which resizes when you rotate the device.
